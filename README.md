# stellar-plugin-sdk

This repository is meant to be linked as submodule and used in external plugins working with [app-stellar](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-stellar).
It is composed of a few headers containing definitions about app-stellar's internal transaction parsing state and some structures to communicate via shared memory.
